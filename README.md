# <In/>Decider
This application was done to fulfill graduation requirements at Coding Dojo.
Built in Java Spring Boot, it's hooked up to a MySQL database and utilizes custom CSS and Bootstrap for styling.
This application allows users to create custom lists in various categories, have full CRUD abilities therein, and have something from those lists randomly selected.
I wanted to build something to appeal to everyone and stray away from past projects that lend themselves only to a narrow or niche audience.
Everyone faces indecision and wishes decisions could be made for them; this app does that!

## Future Goals:
* Sorting / Filtering
* Japanese / Swedish language options
* Additional categories
* Revamped validations
* At least one other color option, available in a button or toggle.
