			<p>&lt;In/&gt;Decider is an app that was made to help anyone needing a quick decision.</p>
			<p>To use it, simply log in, click the category you wish to choose from, and begin building a list of items you're trying to choose from or routinely find yourself indecisive about. You can also view, edit, or delete items on these lists (excluding the random category).</p>
			<p>The application will randomly select something from that list after clicking the 'Choose!' button.</p>
			<p>Parts of the app are purposely designed to make you stick with whatever decision has been made, such as only being able to return to the dashboard after a selection.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This app was inspired by another website I've frequented in the past, the <a href="https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/random/pickone.html" target="_blank">'Pick a Thing Generator'</a> by Andrew Hedges.</p>
			<p>Future goals for this project include: additional language support, categories, sorting options, and themes.</p>
			<p>Created by MJF in December of 2023.</p>
			<p>Made in loving memory of Jim, my Dad, who doubtlessly would've used this to simplify his own decision-making process.</p>
